# OP

A revision of an older programming language made by me (sty00a4-code), which sucked ass.
This one is now actually usable, but I will not maintain it. I only remade it for fun :)

If you wanna now how the language works, you can look at the file `oplang/std.op`
that contains all the pre-built functions for OP written in itself, samples may come some day.
